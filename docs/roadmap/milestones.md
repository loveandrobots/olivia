# Olivia Milestones

## Purpose
These milestones define the evidence required for Olivia to move from concept through MVP and into post-MVP product expansion. They are intended to give future agents clear readiness gates without forcing them to re-derive what phase the project is in.

Unlike `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md`, this document is not a product horizon map. It is an execution-readiness system: what must be true before the project should advance.

## Milestone Model
Each milestone should be considered complete only when:
- the expected artifacts exist
- the key decisions are documented
- open questions are either resolved or explicitly bounded
- the next phase can begin without re-deriving product intent

## M0: Project Foundation
Objective: establish shared understanding of what Olivia is and how the project should be documented.

Status: complete

Required artifacts:
- `docs/vision/product-vision.md`
- `docs/vision/product-ethos.md`
- `docs/strategy/agentic-development-principles.md`
- a documented PM operating model in the durable strategy docs

Exit criteria:
- the product thesis is documented
- the trust model direction is documented
- agent-oriented documentation standards are documented
- the project has a clear statement of scope and non-goals

Evidence of completion:
- a new agent can explain Olivia's purpose, boundaries, and guiding principles from the docs alone

Completion note:
- Olivia has durable vision, ethos, and agentic development guidance in place.

## M1: Product Definition
Objective: define the first meaningful product slice and the user problems it addresses.

Status: complete

Required artifacts:
- `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md`
- `docs/roadmap/milestones.md`
- `docs/glossary.md`
- `docs/specs/first-workflow-candidates.md`
- `docs/learnings/README.md`

Exit criteria:
- the first product wedge is explicit
- the user problems and desired outcomes are documented
- the project has a stable set of product terms
- assumptions and open questions are visible

Evidence of completion:
- a future agent can identify what Olivia should try to do first and what it should deliberately not try to do yet

Completion note:
- The shared household state and follow-through wedge was chosen and documented.

## M2: Delivery Planning
Objective: make the project execution-ready for feature-level planning.

Status: complete

Required artifacts:
- `docs/specs/spec-template.md`
- `docs/learnings/assumptions-log.md`
- `docs/learnings/learnings-log.md`
- `docs/learnings/decision-history.md`
- `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md`

Exit criteria:
- future features can be specified in a consistent, testable structure
- durable project memory has a clear home and maintenance model
- milestone gates are documented well enough to support implementation planning

Evidence of completion:
- a future agent can draft a high-quality feature spec without inventing the documentation structure from scratch

Completion note:
- Olivia now has durable memory docs, a reusable spec template, and stable planning conventions.

## M3: Build Readiness
Objective: prepare the first implementation-ready feature spec or set of specs.

Status: complete

Required artifacts:
- at least one completed feature spec
- acceptance criteria for the first workflow
- bounded implementation assumptions
- documented trust and approval expectations for that workflow

Exit criteria:
- the spec is concrete enough that an implementation agent can execute without major product ambiguity
- unresolved questions are limited and non-blocking
- testing and verification expectations are documented

Evidence of completion:
- an implementation plan can be generated directly from the feature spec without needing to rediscover basic product intent

Completion note:
- The shared household inbox spec was approved for implementation planning and translated into a concrete build plan.

## M4: MVP In Use
Objective: deliver and evaluate the first genuinely useful household workflow.

Status: complete

Required artifacts:
- implementation-ready plan
- built MVP slice
- validation notes from actual use, or an explicit stakeholder decision to advance based on implementation completeness
- updated learnings and decisions based on usage or implementation outcomes

Exit criteria:
- Olivia has a working household coordination workflow with a credible product baseline
- the stakeholder can judge the MVP complete enough to expand the product surface
- product learnings from usage or implementation are captured durably enough to guide the next horizon

Evidence of completion:
- the project can point to a built workflow, a concrete implementation center of gravity, and a documented reason the next horizon can begin

Completion note:
- The stakeholder chose to advance based on implementation completeness and product-shape confidence rather than waiting for a longer household validation cycle.

## M5: Horizon 3 Scoping
Objective: define the product shape of the household coordination layer well enough that future planning compounds on the MVP rather than drifting away from it.

Status: in progress

Required artifacts:
- updated `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md` with concrete Horizon 3 scope
- updated `docs/roadmap/milestones.md`
- updated glossary and learnings reflecting the post-MVP product state
- an explicitly named first Horizon 3 feature-spec target, currently `first-class reminders`

Exit criteria:
- Horizon 3 product direction is concrete enough that implementation agents do not need to guess what comes after the inbox
- the relationship between the inbox, reminders, recurring routines, and shared lists is described at a product level
- the next workflow area is specific enough to enter feature-spec work without ambiguity about which spec comes first

Evidence of completion:
- a new agent can identify what Olivia should build next, why it matters, and what should remain deferred

## M6: Coordination Layer Build Readiness
Objective: prepare the first Horizon 3 workflow or set of workflows for implementation planning.

Status: not started

Required artifacts:
- implementation-ready feature specs for the next Horizon 3 workflow area
- architectural notes for any shared infrastructure introduced by Horizon 3, such as recurrence or cross-workflow notifications
- implementation plan for at least the first Horizon 3 workflow
- updated assumptions, decisions, and open questions tied to the new workflow area

Exit criteria:
- each planned workflow has acceptance criteria, scope boundaries, and trust-model implications documented
- shared infrastructure decisions are bounded enough that engineering plans do not have to resolve product ambiguity
- implementation agents can plan the next build phase directly from the docs

Evidence of completion:
- an implementation plan can be generated for the next Horizon 3 workflow without rediscovering the product model

## M7: Coordination Layer In Use
Objective: deliver and evaluate household coordination workflows beyond the original inbox so Olivia becomes a broader coordination surface.

Status: not started

Required artifacts:
- built Horizon 3 workflows
- validation notes from actual use
- updated learnings and decision history based on post-MVP household use
- evidence of how the new workflows integrate with the inbox and broader coordination model

Exit criteria:
- the household uses capabilities beyond the original inbox for routine coordination
- the coordination layer reduces friction for recurring work, shared lists, or adjacent planning tasks
- follow-on product priorities are informed by actual use rather than only roadmap intent

Evidence of completion:
- the project can show specific household coordination problems Olivia now supports beyond the original inbox workflow

## Milestone Gate Questions
Before moving to the next milestone, ask:
- Do the docs make the current phase legible to a new agent?
- Have the most important decisions been recorded durably?
- Are remaining unknowns explicitly visible?
- Is the next phase narrow enough to execute well?
- Is there evidence, not optimism, that the project is ready to advance?
- Does the next capability extend the existing product model coherently rather than becoming a disconnected tool?
- Is any shared infrastructure reusable across workflow types, or are we hiding product ambiguity inside engineering work?

## Decisions
- Milestones are defined by readiness and evidence, not by volume of output.
- The project should not move into implementation until feature-level ambiguity is low enough for agent execution.
- Post-MVP milestones should make product expansion legible, not only initial build readiness.

## Open Questions
- What level of household validation should be required before broadening scope after a working MVP exists?
- Should milestone reviews later become a recurring template or checklist?
