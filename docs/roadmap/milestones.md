# Olivia Milestones

## Purpose
These milestones define the evidence required for Olivia to move from concept through MVP and into post-MVP product expansion. They are intended to give future agents clear readiness gates without forcing them to re-derive what phase the project is in.

Unlike `docs/roadmap/roadmap.md`, this document is not a product horizon map. It is an execution-readiness system: what must be true before the project should advance.

## Milestone Model
Each milestone should be considered complete only when:
- the expected artifacts exist
- the key decisions are documented
- open questions are either resolved or explicitly bounded
- the next phase can begin without re-deriving product intent

## Completed Milestones Summary

## M28: Household Validation & Phase 3 Scoping

Status: bypassed (board directive)

This was a validation milestone, not a build milestone. The intended deliverable was a usage-informed product direction decision.

**Bypass note (2026-03-16):** M28 was effectively bypassed by direct board assignment. The board assigned OLI-95 ("Support Olivia chat interface") as the Phase 3 direction before the M28 validation gate could complete. The Phase 3 direction decision (D-053) was made by board directive rather than by the usage-observation process M28 defined. This is a legitimate board prerogative, but the following M28 exit criteria were not met:
- the 2-week household usage observation period did not elapse
- qualitative usage observations were not documented
- assumptions A-007, A-008, A-009 remain unvalidated by household usage

Future milestones should continue to follow the gate process. The M28 bypass is recorded honestly so future agents understand that the chat direction was board-driven, not observation-gated.

## M29: Post-Chat Household Validation & Next-Direction Scoping
Objective: observe real household usage of the full product surface — including the newly shipped chat interface — to produce the usage signal that M28 was designed to capture but did not, then scope the next build cycle based on that signal.

Status: todo

Context:
- H5 Phases 1–3 shipped without household validation (M28 bypassed by board directive).
- The product now includes: inbox, reminders, recurring routines, shared lists, meal planning (all H3 workflows complete), unified weekly view, activity history, planning rituals, AI-assisted summaries, proactive nudges, push notifications, completion-window timing, and a chat interface.
- This is a substantial feature surface. Before adding more, we need to know what the household actually uses, what it ignores, and where friction exists.

Required artifacts:
- household usage observations — qualitative notes on which features see real use, which are ignored, where friction appears, and what the household asks for or avoids. Captured in `docs/learnings/` as observations (L-series entries), not requirements.
- chat-specific observations — how the household uses the chat surface: what kinds of questions are asked, whether draft action cards are used or dismissed, whether chat replaces screen navigation or supplements it.
- updated assumptions log — validate or challenge assumptions running on implementation evidence alone (A-007, A-008, A-009) plus new questions about conversational vs. structured interaction preferences and advisory-only trust model fit.
- Phase 4 direction decision (D-054+) — informed by usage observations. Candidate tracks:
  - **Track A: Deepen the chat** — summarization, proactive messages, richer tool use, spouse access
  - **Track B: Broaden the household** — spouse write access, multi-user roles
  - **Track C: Complete H3** — meal planning (spec drafted, primitives proven)
  - **Track D: Increase autonomy** — rule-based automation, push action buttons, Layer 2 LLM timing
  - **Track E: Deepen the coordination surface** — task steps/sub-tasks (OLI-242, spec drafted), shared calendar via native Apple Calendar integration (OLI-243, D-063)
- updated roadmap reflecting the chosen direction

Exit criteria:
- at least two weeks of household usage (including chat) have elapsed since deployment
- at least 3 qualitative chat observations documented
- at least 3 qualitative broader product observations documented
- the CEO has recorded a next-direction decision based on usage signal
- the next milestone (M30) is defined with objectives tracing back to usage observations

Notes:
- This milestone restores the validation gate that M28 was designed to provide. The board may again choose to direct the next cycle; if so, record the bypass honestly and proceed.
- Meal planning (Track C) completes H3 — if usage signal is ambiguous, completing H3 is a strong default.

## M30: [Direction TBD — defined by M29 exit]
Objective: to be scoped after M29 produces usage-informed direction signal.

Status: not started

This milestone is intentionally undefined. M29's purpose is to produce the signal that shapes M30.

## Milestone Gate Questions
Before moving to the next milestone, ask:
- Do the docs make the current phase legible to a new agent?
- Have the most important decisions been recorded durably?
- Are remaining unknowns explicitly visible?
- Is the next phase narrow enough to execute well?
- Is there evidence, not optimism, that the project is ready to advance?
- Does the next capability extend the existing product model coherently rather than becoming a disconnected tool?
- Is any shared infrastructure reusable across workflow types, or are we hiding product ambiguity inside engineering work?

## Decisions
- Milestones are defined by readiness and evidence, not by volume of output.
- The project should not move into implementation until feature-level ambiguity is low enough for agent execution.
- Post-MVP milestones should make product expansion legible, not only initial build readiness.

## Open Questions
- What level of household validation should be required before broadening scope after a working MVP exists?
- Should milestone reviews later become a recurring template or checklist?
